ShoppingListBudgetTracker
=========================

This is a small iPhone app built in Swift, utilizing the CoreData framework that allows you to create multiple shopping lists, set a budget for each list and then add items to that list.  This app will keep track of money spent and will let you know when you are over budget.  This app is good for those on a tight budget.

This app will only run in portrait mode.  No iPad support.  You must have iOS 8 or above installed.
